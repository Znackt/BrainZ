Hey ! How are you doing ?
I’m building a high-intensity community called 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝟏𝟎𝟎 — it’s a group of devs, designers, and business folks who are down to grind hard (10–12 hrs daily) to build skills, network, and level up fast.
Picture this: accountability, team building, and deep convos around product, marketing, growth, and more.

It’s on Discord for now.
Super early stage, handpicking a solid crew.
Would love to have you in if you’re up for the hustle 👊

Want the invite?

Great, I will be happy to have you there
